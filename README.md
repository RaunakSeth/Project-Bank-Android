| 1.) | SIH Hackathon 2022  |   DR716    | "Background: There are more than 1000 universities in India and these universities are offering thousands of undergraduate, post-Graduate and doctorate courses. The students applying for these universities have to do a lot of comparison for choosing the university/course on the basis of various criteria’s. A PAN India university information bank is required for accessing course details, comparison of courses, facilities and faculty, admission, tracking student mobility, viewing results, evaluation and certification, verification of certificates, joint online courses (MOOCs). This will help both student and faculty communities for self improvement through comparison and emulations. Lack of information is leading to self glorification and inbreeding among University and College student and faculty members. Summary: The universities in India provide various courses on different disciplines and the students have to compare these courses on the basis of various parameters. The courses range from Bachelor, Masters and P.hd courses. The integration of these details on a single platform will enhance the transparency and remove difficulty being faced by the students due to lack of information. Objective: : To develop an integrated platform to provide the information of the courses offered by Indian universities"|

By using latest Innovative Ideas, Mobile App may be developed for providing some of the important/frequently required useful information like, approved & unapproved institutions, etc., which are presently displayed under Statistics (Dashboard). Organization will look for attractive Mobile App developed with latest innovative ideas to display/provide information on some of the important activities of AICTE with user friendly concept. Summary: Mobile application development for the AICTE for providing the relevant information to the concerned stake holders will result in: 1. Easy access to information 2. User Friendly Mode Objective: : To develop a Mobile App for AICTE" Data- www.aicte-india.org & Statistics > Dash board|
| 3.)|SIH Hackathon 2022| DR712          |"Background: Retirement of faculties and appointment of faculties in colleges is not standardised in our country. While retirements are mandatory on superannuation, steps to fill up the vacancy that arises immediately is lacking. When a vacancy arises in the middle of the academic year on account of the superannuation of a faculty, the students are the victims. There should be state or National registry or databank to assess the actual faculty requirement college-wise keeping in view the date of retirement and number of teachers who retire, so that recruitment process can start well in advance and the faculty is readily available as soon as a faculty retires. Standard of education in India cannot be improved unless we fill all the vacancies every year selecting suitable candidates. Summary: Faculty’s appointment in colleges tend to be slow in our country when there is an immediate need of faculty. This happens because in so short notice it is impossible to get a faculty for the college. This problem makes the students victim where they lack behind in their academics. Addressing this problem can help in appointing faculties in a very roburst process. Objective: : We need you to create an app which will indicate the future vacancies and positions so that proper planning of recruitment is possible. All the data of faculties who are retiring or leaving the institute should be updated in the app and simultaneously find out faculties for that position who are ready to join. This would help to decrease in manually searching for faculties and automatically find and contact the faculties who are interested to join."|

For better understanding let’s say a group of college friends.Now, whenever any event is completed (let’s take pizza party as our event) and bills are paid then any one member of the group can create an event on the app mentioning the total amount, and how much amount is paid by each individual.With the event being created, the application smartly calculates and distributes the total amount according to how much each of them paid, and shows a detailed report of who should pay to whom and how much, in order to equally distribute the total amount.Also, the application provides a payment feature, so that after the report is generated they can transfer the money using UPI in just one click.|

As the popularity of generative AI technology accelerates, starting with Stable Diffusion, more and more people are using text-to-image to generate AI artworks by entering various prompts using DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. The quality and desired results of AI creations entirely depend on the quality of prompts, which is why the importance of prompt engineering is emerging. Due to the significance of the prompts, some marketplaces specialize in trading prompts called Promptbase and Promptsea. Despite the rapid mass adoption of generative AI, there are evident problems that we want to highlight.First is the total absence of a dedicated community for AI creations. Currently, people are forming communities based on Discord and Reddit. If you look into the case of Midjourney, despite having more than 1.2 million community users, they rely on Discord. The community utilizes Discord bot for API integration, and its limit is evident for newcomers to onboard, hard to achieve, and manage their artwork. Here, Duckee would be the best place for AI creators to gather around and share their artwork. In the 'Explore' tab, you can discover various artists' collectibles based on keywords with seamless UX. While exploring, easily find your favorite artist and follow their collections.The second issue we want to address the most is the copyright issue of the AI prompts. Due to the lack of a system and ambiguity in the specification of copyright issues, it is challenging to track secondary creations. In Duckee, we want to bring AI creations and prompts on-chain, making it technologically possible for anyone to digitize their copyright and track secondary outcomes using a derivable NFT system.To summarize, Duckee is the world's first platform for AI creators to explore, generate and tokenize their artworks.|

Did you know that a commuter in Indian cities spends around 80+ hours every year looking for parking spaces?The problem is – even as the number of vehicles is continuously increasing, parking space in Indian cities has remained constant or has reduced due to constant growth in the population.There are few existing applications in Play Store that have one of the following:First, the parking area creator has to manually create an area while jotting markers on a map. (Four markers for a rectangle area)Second, the creator as well as the user would definitely face GPS-based issues, since it takes >15 satellites to pinpoint a location.Hence, we made an AR-based Android application that uses Google's new Geospatial API to use VPS(Virtual Positioning System) with added AR anchor to show the user the exact area to park a vehicle.The ARCore Geospatial API enables you to remotely attach content to any area covered by Google Street View and create AR experiences on a global scale. It uses device sensors and GPS data to detect the device's environment, then matches the recognizable parts of that environment to a localization model provided by Google’s Visual Positioning System (VPS) to determine the precise location of a user’s device. The API also takes care of merging the user’s local coordinates with the geographic coordinates from VPS so that you can work within a single coordinate system.So, here's our demoed solution:A contributor can create a parking spot by tapping on the Create button. He/she will have to scan the area and tap on the map to set a parking slot.A user in need of a parking slot would use Google Maps, he/she will mark a marker and select the AR mode to get the exact spot of parking. One superb use case is Multilevel Parking.|

As, these records serve to help students apply for extra attendance during club events and help college authorities to keep track of clubs. For this, a comprehensive app solution with good and responsive UI/UX is required to easily make it possible for smooth functioning of clubs.”|
